## The Goals of Data Wrangling:

When wrangling data, you want to get data into a tidy shape / format for analysis. Me might want to:
  - Keep only certain observations
  - Define new variables
  - Reformat or "clean" existing variables
  - Combine various datasets
  - Process "string" or text data

We want to numerically, not just visually, explore and summarize various characteristics of the variable in our dataset

| `arrange`   | **arrange** the *rows* according to some *column* |
| `filter`    | **filter** out or obtain a subset of the *rows*   |
| `select`    | **select** a subset of *columns*                  |
| `mutate`    | **mutate** or create a *column*                   |
| `summarize` | calculate a numerical **summary** of a *column*   |
| `group_by`  | **group** the *rows* by a specified *column*      |
