Use this file to generate a professional looking **univariate** visualization. The visualization will not perfect the first time but you are expected to improve on it throughout the semester especially after covering advanced topics such as effective viz.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

messy_movies <- read_csv("../data/MoviesOnStreamingPlatforms.csv")

movies_len <- messy_movies |>
  mutate(title_len = str_length(Title)) |>
  select(title_len)

ggplot(movies_len, aes(x = title_len)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", 
                 binwidth = 5,
                 fill = "#458B74") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x = "Total Characters in Title",
       y = "Movies and TV Shows",
       title = "Movies and TV Shows Versus the Characters in Their Title")
```
