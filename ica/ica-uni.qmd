## Exercises

```{r}
#| eval: true

library(tidyverse)

# Import data
hikes <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/high_peaks.csv")
```


### Exercise 1: Research Questions {.unnumbered}

Let's dig into the `hikes` data, starting with the `elevation` and difficulty `ratings` of the hikes:

```{r}
#| eval: true

head(hikes)
```

a.  What features would we like a visualization of the *categorical* difficulty `rating` variable to capture?

 - We would want to capture the difficulty rating through faceting, separating it into groups, to compare and contrast them
 
b.  What about a visualization of the *quantitative* `elevation` variable?

 - We would want to capture the difficulty rating to be captured in either the y-axis or x-axis of a frame

### Exercise 2: Load tidyverse {.unnumbered}

We'll address the above questions using `ggplot` tools. Try running the following chunk and simply take note of the error message -- this is one you'll get a lot!

```{r}
# Use the ggplot function
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating))
```

In order to use `ggplot` tools, we have to first *load* the `tidyverse` package in which they live. We've *installed* the package but we need to tell R when we want to *use* it. Run the chunk below to load the library. You'll need to do this within any .qmd file that uses `ggplot()`.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| message: false

# Load the package
library(tidyverse)
```



### Exercise 3: Bar Chart of Ratings - Part 1 {.unnumbered}

Consider some specific research questions about the difficulty `rating` of the hikes:

1. How many hikes fall into each category?

2. Are the hikes evenly distributed among these categories, or are some more common than others?

All of these questions can be answered with: (1) a **bar chart**; of (2) the *categorical* data recorded in the `rating` column. First, set up the plotting **frame**:

```{r}
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating))
```

Think about:

-   What did this do? What do you observe?
-   What, in general, is the first argument of the `ggplot()` function?
-   What is the purpose of writing `x = rating`?
-   What do you think `aes` stands for?!?


### Exercise 4: Bar Chart of Ratings - Part 2 {.unnumbered}

Now let's add a **geometric layer** to the frame / canvas, and start customizing the plot's **theme**. To this end, try each chunk below, *one by one*. In each chunk, make a comment about how both the code and the corresponding plot both changed.

NOTE:

-   Pay attention to the general code properties and structure, not memorization.
-   Not all of these are "good" plots. We're just exploring `ggplot`.

```{r}
# This added a second line, geom_bar(), which added the geometric element of a bar representing quantity of a variable to the ggplot(hikes)
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_bar()
```

```{r}
# This added a third line of code, labs(x = "Rating", y = "Number of hikes"), which defined the x-axis and y-axis for the ggplot(hikes). "ratings" was already the x-axis, but it was capitalized, and the y-axis changed from "count" to "Number of hikes"
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(x = "Rating", y = "Number of hikes")
```

```{r}
# This added a function to the geom_bar(), adding fill = "blue" to it, which made the bars blue
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "blue") +
  labs(x = "Rating", y = "Number of hikes")
```

```{r}
# This changed the geom_bar line of code, adding in color = orange, making the whole bar orange including its edges, but then the fill function filled in the inner part of the bars to be blue, making the edges of the bar orange and the filling blue
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_bar(color = "orange", fill = "blue") +
  labs(x = "Rating", y = "Number of hikes")
```

```{r}
# This added a third line of code, theme_minimal(), making the background white instead of grey
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = rating)) +
  geom_bar(color = "orange", fill = "blue")  +
  labs(x = "Rating", y = "Number of hikes") +
  theme_minimal()
```



### Exercise 5: Bar Chart Follow-up {.unnumbered}

#### Part a {.unnumbered}

Reflect on the `ggplot()` code.

-   What's the purpose of the `+`? When do we use it?
   - The point of the + is to add on changes to the hike data within the ggplot
-   We added the bars using `geom_bar()`? Why "geom"?
   - geom_bar() is called geom because it is short for geometric element (a bar in this case)
-   What does `labs()` stand for?
   - labs() is short for labels
-   What's the difference between `color` and `fill`?
   - Color changes the color of the whole bar, whereas fill fill in the inner part of the bar

#### Part b {.unnumbered}

In general, bar charts allow us to examine the following properties of a *categorical* variable:

-   **observed categories**: What categories did we observe?
   - We saw the categories of easy, moderate, and difficult rating of each observation
-   **variability between categories**: Are observations evenly spread out among the categories, or are some categories more common than others?
   - Observations are not evenly spread out among difficulty ratings, with moderate being the most common, and difficult being the least common

We must then *translate* this information into the *context* of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks. Summarize below what you learned from the bar chart, in context.
   - From the bar chart we learned that most people are more likely to rate their hikes on trails as moderate than difficult or easy. They are least likely to rate their hike as difficult, but only slightly less than they are to rate it as easy.

#### Part c {.unnumbered}

Is there anything you don't like about this barplot? For example: check out the x-axis again.
   - This bar chart should graduate its classes of difficulty from easy to difficult, to make it intuitively easier to read, but it instead places the difficult bar furthest left and the moderate bar the furthest right
 
### Exercise 6: Sad Bar Chart {.unnumbered}

Let's now consider some research questions related to the *quantitative* `elevation` variable:

1. Among the hikes, what's the *range* of elevation and how are the hikes *distributed* within this range (e.g. evenly, in clumps, "normally")?
   - Hikes are relatively evenly distributed, with few observations that have the same elevation. The range is from roughly 3,500 ft to 6,00 ft
2. What's a *typical* elevation?
   - Because elevation is roughly evenly spread, it is difficult to find an average or median to resemble the elevation of most of the observations effectively. A median or average might fall around 4,400 ft.
3. Are there any *outliers*, i.e. hikes that have unusually high or low elevations?
 - two observaitons, above 5,000 ft, and 4 observations below 4,000 ft stand out as outliers

Here:

-   Construct a **bar chart** of the *quantitative* `elevation` variable.
-   Explain why this might *not* be an effective visualization for this and other quantitative variables. (What questions does / doesn't it help answer?)
   - This bar chart allows us to see the distribution of elevation, but it does not effectively reveal a median or average for the human eye because the results are seemingly quite evenly distributed but not (with a few breakaway chunks). The x-axis, the count of observations per an elevation, isn't very useful because there are nearly no observations with the same elevation and it mostly just clutters the image, whose main value is showing the distribution of elevations.

```{r}

ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) + geom_bar(color = "orange") + theme_minimal()

```



### Exercise 7: A Histogram of Elevation {.unnumbered}

Quantitative variables require different viz than categorical variables. Especially when there are many possible outcomes of the quantitative variable. It's typically insufficient to simply count up the number of times we've observed a particular outcome as the bar graph did above. It gives us a sense of ranges and typical outcomes, but not a good sense of how the observations are distributed across this range. We'll explore two methods for graphing quantitative variables: **histograms** and **density plots**.

**Histograms** are constructed by (1) dividing up the observed range of the variable into 'bins' of equal width; and (2) counting up the number of cases that fall into each bin. Check out the example below:

![](https://mac-stat.github.io/images/112/histogram_demo.png){width="50%"}

#### Part a {.unnumbered}

Let's dig into some details.

-   How many hikes have an elevation between 4500 and 4700 feet?
   - 6
-   How many total hikes have an elevation of at least 5100 feet?
   - a little less than 4

#### Part b {.unnumbered}

Now the bigger picture. In general, histograms allow us to examine the following properties of a *quantitative* variable:

-   **typical outcome:** Where’s the center of the data points? What's typical?
-   **variability & range:** How spread out are the outcomes? What are the max and min outcomes?
-   **shape:** How are values distributed along the observed range? Is the distribution symmetric, right-skewed, left-skewed, bi-modal, or uniform (flat)?
-   **outliers:** Are there any outliers, i.e. outcomes that are unusually large/small?

We must then *translate* this information into the *context* of our analysis, here hikes in the Adirondacks. Addressing each of the features in the above list, summarize below what you learned from the histogram, in context.

 - Typical outcome: this historogram illustrated how hikes in the Adirondacks tend to be focused around 4000-5000 feet in elevation
 - Variability and range: this historogram showed that the elevation of the hikes tend to concentrate towards the lower end of the range, but also illustrates that there are outliers on the edge
 -shape: this historogram shows that the shape is of the distribution is a hump that quickly rises on the edge of the range, and gradually drops off as it goes right
 - outliers: this historogram shows that there were a few outliers at the lower elevation, and more at the higher elevations

### Exercise 8: Building Histograms - Part 1 {.unnumbered}

2-MINUTE CHALLENGE: Thinking of the bar chart code, try to *intuit* what line you can tack on to the below frame of `elevation` to add a histogram layer. Don't forget a `+`. If it doesn't come to you within 2 minutes, *no problem* -- all will be revealed in the next exercise.

```{r}
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation, y = difficulty)) 
  #geom_histogram(breaks = c(1, 1000, 1001, 2000, 2001, 3000))
```


### Exercise 9: Building Histograms - Part 2 {.unnumbered}

Let's build some histograms. Try each chunk below, *one by one*. In each chunk, make a comment about how both the code and the corresponding plot both changed.

```{r}
# instead of using geom_bar, geom_historogram was used which automatically created bins
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

```{r}
# ( color = "white") was added to geom_historogram which added a white outline to each bar in the historogram, separating the bars and making it easier to read
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white") 
```

```{r}
# fill = "blue" was added to geom_historogram(color = "white") which made the fill of the bars blue
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", fill = "blue") 
```

```{r}
# labs() was added and a value was added to the x-axis and y-axis was added between the parentheses which changed their labels on the historogram
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white") +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")
```

```{r}
# The width of the bins was changed to be 1000, and since the range was 2000, two bins were created that are displayed as bars
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 1000) +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")
```

```{r}
# The binwidth was changed to 5, and because the range was 2000, many bars could be created across such a large range with such small bins
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 5) +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")
```

```{r}
# The binwidth was changed to 200, and across a range of roughly 2000 there were a few observations that fell into each bin making a relatively normal looking historogram
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 200) +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")
```


### Exercise 10: Histogram Follow-up {.unnumbered}

-   What function added the histogram layer / geometry?
   - geom_historogram
-   What's the difference between `color` and `fill`?
   - color makes the outline of the historogram bars the same as the input color, fill fills the whole bar excluding the outline
-   Why does adding `color = "white"` improve the visualization?
  - it makes it easier to differentiate the bars visually, improving readability
-   What did `binwidth` do?
  - it set the range of the bins, which would then determine how many bins were in the historogram based on the range of the data/binwidth
-   Why does the histogram become ineffective if the `binwidth` is too big (e.g. 1000 feet)?
   - it fits too many observations into the same bin, which may have drastically different values
-   Why does the histogram become ineffective if the `binwidth` is too small (e.g. 5 feet)?
   - it does not fit enough results into each bin, making it harder to aggregate and therefore read


### Exercise 11: Density Plots {.unnumbered}

**Density plots** are essentially smooth versions of the histogram. Instead of sorting observations into discrete bins, the "density" of observations is calculated across the entire range of outcomes. The greater the number of observations, the greater the density! The density is then scaled so that the area under the density curve **always equals 1** and the area under any fraction of the curve represents the fraction of cases that lie in that range.

Check out a density plot of elevation. Notice that the y-axis (density) has no contextual interpretation -- it's a relative measure. The *higher* the density, the more *common* are elevations in that range.

```{r}
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_density()
```

**Questions**

-   INTUITION CHECK: Before tweaking the code and thinking back to `geom_bar()` and `geom_histogram()`, how do you *anticipate* the following code will change the plot?

    -   `geom_density(color = "blue")`
    -   `geom_density(fill = "orange")`

-   TRY IT! Test out those lines in the chunk below. Was your intuition correct?

```{r}
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) + geom_density(color = "blue") + geom_density(fill = "orange")
```

-   Examine the density plot. How does it compare to the histogram? What does it tell you about the *typical* elevation, *variability / range* in elevations, and *shape* of the distribution of *elevations* within this range?

   - The density plot tells you the range of the x-axis, but nothing about the range of the y-axis. It tells you the shape of the distribution of elevations effectively, giving it an organic and easy to read shape. Overall, from this density plot we can see that there are very few hikes at the lower end of the range, a high number at the low-to-mid level, and a decline in the number of hikes at the top of the range.

### Exercise 12: Density Plots vs Histograms {.unnumbered}

The histogram and density plot both allow us to visualize the behavior of a quantitative variable: typical outcome, variability / range, shape, and outliers. What are the pros/cons of each? What do you like/not like about each?

   - The historogram provides more data about the range of the y-axis, but it does not have an organic shape that allows one to see the distribution of observations along the y-axis (unless it has tiny bins, which is a bad visualization) and it cant fit observations with wildly different values into the same bin. The density plot does not provide any information about the range of the y-axis. It makes up for this by providing information about the distribution of observations on the y-axis

### Exercise 13: Code = communication {.unnumbered}

We *obviously* won't be done until we talk about communication. All code above has a similar *general* structure (where the details can change):

```{r}
#| eval: false

ggplot(___, aes(x = ___)) + 
  geom___(color = "___", fill = "___") + 
  labs(x = "___", y = "___")
```

-   Though not *necessary* to the code working, it's common, good practice to *indent* or *tab* the lines of code after the first line (counterexample below). Why?

```{r}
# YUCK
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 200) +
labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")
```

-   Though not *necessary* to the code working, it's common, good practice to put a *line break* after each `+` (counterexample below). Why?

```{r}
# YUCK 
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) + geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 200) + labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")
```

### Exercise 5: Bar Chart Follow-up {.unnumbered}

#### Part a {.unnumbered}

-   To indicate we're still adding layers to / modifying our plot.
-   Bars are the `geom`etric elements we're adding in this layer.
-   labels
-   `fill` fills in the bars. `color` outlines the bars.

#### Part b {.unnumbered}

Most hikes are moderate, the fewest number are difficult.

#### Part c {.unnumbered}

I don't like that the categories are alphabetical, not in order of difficulty level.



### Exercise 6: Sad Bar Chart {.unnumbered}

There are too many different outcomes of elevation.

```{r}
#| eval: true

ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) + 
  geom_bar()
```



### Exercise 7: A Histogram of Elevation {.unnumbered}

#### Part a {.unnumbered}

-   6
-   1 + 1 = 2

#### Part b {.unnumbered}

Elevations range from roughly 3700 to 5500 feet. Elevations vary from hike to hike relatively *normally* (with a bell shape) around a typical elevation of roughly 4500 feet.



### Exercise 9: Building Histograms - Part 2 {.unnumbered}

```{r}
#| eval: true

# Add a histogram layer
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram()

# Outline the bars in white
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white") 

# Fill the bars in blue
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", fill = "blue") 

# Add axis labels
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white") +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")

# Change the width of the bins to 1000 feet
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 1000) +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")

# Change the width of the bins to 5 feet
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 5) +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")

# Change the width of the bins to 200 feet
ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", binwidth = 200) +
  labs(x = "Elevation (feet)", y = "Number of hikes")
```


### Exercise 10: Histogram Follow-up {.unnumbered}

-   `geom_histogram()`
-   `color` outlined the bars and `fill` filled them
-   easier to distinguish between the bars
-   changed the bin width
-   we lump too many hikes together and lose track of the nuances
-   we don't lump enough hikes together and lose track of the bigger picture trends


### Exercise 11: Density plots {.unnumbered}

```{r}
#| eval: true

ggplot(hikes, aes(x = elevation)) +
 geom_density(color = "blue", fill = "orange")
```


### Exercise 13: Code = Communication {.unnumbered}

-   Clarifies that the subsequent lines are a continuation of the first. That is, we're not done with the plot yet. These lines are all part of the same idea.
-   This is like a run-on sentence. It's tough to track the distinct steps that go into building the plot.
